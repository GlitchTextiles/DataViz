# DataViz

A reasonably simple tool to transform zeros and ones into images.

## Install

* [Download and install processing](https://processing.org/download/)
* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/phillipdavidstearns/DataViz.git`
* Install the `controlP5` library using the built in library management tool.

## How to Use

* Double click `DataViz.pde`
* Click the open button to open any file
* Click buttons and grab sliders until it looks good
* Click save, give it a name, and optional extension (PNG by default).

## To Do

This broke during the upgrade from Processing 2 to Processing 3. I still haven't put it all back together...

* Link keybindings for those less inclined to point and click
* Implement argument parsing for command line executing and scriptability for those adverse to GUIs
* Add some cool color customization tools to get less literal and more freaky with colorization

## Contribute

Fork, setup a branch for yourself, work some magic, submit a pull request.
